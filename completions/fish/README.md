# Install

## Manually

1. See where your `fish` configuration stores completion scripts

```
~ echo $fish_complete_path
/Users/hasitmistry/.config/fish/completions /usr/local/etc/fish/completions /usr/local/share/fish/completions /Users/hasitmistry/.local/share/fish/generated_completions
```

2. Copy `buffalo.fish` file to one of those directories; preferably into `~/.config/fish/completions`.

```
~ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo/completions/fish/README.md $fish_complete_path[1]
```

## The `grift` way

1. Go to `gobuffalo/buffalo` project directory

```
~ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo/
g/s/g/g/buffalo ‚ïç
```

2. Run `completions:fish` grift

```
~ grift completions:fish
```

Learn more about `grifts` [here](https://github.com/markbates/grift).

# Use

Once you have the `buffalo.fish` file situated in the correct directory, `fish` should be able to tab complete `buffalo` commands. Try typing `buffalo<TAB><TAB>` like so.

```
~ buffalo<TAB><TAB>

console                                (Runs your Buffalo app in a REPL console)
