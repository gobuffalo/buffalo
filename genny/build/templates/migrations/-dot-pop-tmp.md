hi! i'm just here to ensure that `buffalo build` has a `./migrations` if the application has pop.

unfortunately, i'm just temporary, so as much as i would love to meet you, and trust me, i really would (i've heard good things), i have to be going. :(

if you're seeing me in your application, then something horribly, horribly wrong happened during `buffalo build`, or you ran it with the `-d` flag. :)

regardless, should you come across me laying about, feel free and delete me. it's ok. it won't hurt. well, it might if you use the `-f` flag, i don't know.

i'll leave you with these famous parting words:

>> So long, and thanks for all the fish
