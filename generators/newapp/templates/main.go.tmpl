# Notes about `main.go`

## SSL Support

We recommend placing your application behind a proxy, such as
Apache or Nginx and letting them do the SSL heaving lifting
for you. https://gobuffalo.io/en/docs/proxy

## Buffalo Build

When `buffalo build` is run to compile your binary this `main`
function will be at the heart of that binary. It is expected
that your `main` function will start your application using
the `app.Serve()` method.
