/* TODO: consider to split out Home (or Router, whatever) from App #road-to-v1
   Group and Domain based multi-homing are actually not an App if the concept
   of the App represents the application. The App should be only one for whole
   application.

   For an extreme example, App.Group().Stop() or even App.Group().Serve() are
   still valid function calls while they should not be allowed and the result
   could be strage.

// default Home, including initializing and stopping its all components such
// as listeners and long-running jobs, Home is only for a specific group of
