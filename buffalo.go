/*
Package buffalo is a Go web development eco-system, designed to make your life easier.

Buffalo helps you to generate a web project that already has everything from front-end (JavaScript, SCSS, etc.) to back-end (database, routing, etc.) already hooked up and ready to run. From there it provides easy APIs to build your web application quickly in Go.

Buffalo **isn't just a framework**, it's a holistic web development environment and project structure that **lets developers get straight to the business** of, well, building their business.
