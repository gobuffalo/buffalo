## [2.0.0] - 2015-09-02

- Mailer has been removed. It has been replaced by Dialer and Sender.
- `File` type and the `CreateFile` and `OpenFile` functions have been removed.
- `Message.Attach` and `Message.Embed` have a new signature.
- `Message.GetBodyWriter` has been removed. Use `Message.AddAlternativeWriter`
instead.
- `Message.Export` has been removed. `Message.WriteTo` can be used instead.
- `Message.DelHeader` has been removed.
- The `Bcc` header field is no longer sent. It is far more simpler and
efficient: the same message is sent to all recipients instead of sending a
different email to each Bcc address.
- LoginAuth has been removed. `NewPlainDialer` now implements the LOGIN
authentication mechanism when needed.
- Go 1.2 is now required instead of Go 1.3. No external dependency are used when
using Go 1.5.
